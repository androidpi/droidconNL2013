Furthermore we use [bower][] to install packages for the web.

bower depends on [npm][] for its installation. npm comes installed
with [node][]. Go to [node's download][node-download] page to retrieve
a distribution.

After that running `[sudo] npm install -g bower` will install bower
globally on your system.

This allows one to execute the following command to install all web
packages needed by this presentation.

```shell
bower install
```
